## Summary
In this project, we are building a Deep Learning Model which is capable to detect wheat heads from images using Detectron2, Weights and biases for experimentation. This Project takes a image of wheats and output the image with bounding box of wheat heads.

### Libraries used
* Python
* Detectron2
* PyTorch
